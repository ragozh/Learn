  - 'The <b>command pattern</b> encapuslates actions or requests inside of objects,
    giving control over timing and playback. Undoability is one common application.


    In
    this demo, the <b>MoveCommand</b> class implements the <b>ICommand</b> interface,
    which contains two methods, <b>Execute</b> and <b>Undo</b>.'
  - 'Move the player around the maze and then undo or redo the movement. The <b>CommandInvoker</b>
    manages the execution, undoing, and redoing of commands using two stacks.


    Commands
    are pushed to an undo stack upon execution. Undoing a command transfers it to
    a redo stack.'
  - 'This undo and redo mechanism makes it easier for the player to explore the level.


    Use
    the command pattern whenever you want extra control over the timing of specific
    actions.'
