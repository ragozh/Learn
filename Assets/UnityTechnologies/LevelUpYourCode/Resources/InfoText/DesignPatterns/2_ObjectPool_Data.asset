  - 'This demo shows a gun and projectile system that uses the <b>object pool</b>
    pattern to manage resources.


    This approach optimizes performance by reusing
    existing instances instead of frequently instantiating and destroying them. The
    pool can optionally expand to a predefined maximum size.'
  - 'Use the <b>UnityEngine.Pool</b> namespace (available in Unity 2021 LTS and later)
    to simplifiy object pooling.


    This includes classes like <b>ObjectPool<T></b>
    for efficient object reuse.'
  - 'The gun component initializes an object pool for the projectiles with options
    for capacity and maximum size, ensuring efficient memory management.


    On
    player input, the gun retrieves a projectile from the pool, positions it at the
    muzzle, and applies force to simulate shooting.'
  - 'Each projectile is automatically deactivated and reset after a set delay. Then,
    they are returned to the pool.


    Projectiles are only active during their
    intended use. This pattern reduces overhead from object creation and destruction,
    improving performance during intense gameplay.'
