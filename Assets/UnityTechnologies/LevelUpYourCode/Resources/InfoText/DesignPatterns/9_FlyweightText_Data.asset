  - 'The <b>flyweight pattern</b> is a structural design pattern that optimizes memory
    consumption across a multitude of similar objects.


    By centralizing shared
    data among objects, this pattern significantly reduces memory overhead and enhances
    performance.'
  - 'Consider a scenario in your game where you need to deploy thousands of space
    ships. These ships can share numerous attributes (e.g., models, textures, and
    base stats).


    However, they may vary in specific details like shield strength
    or weapon loadouts, allowing each ship to maintain its individuality.'
  - 'The flyweight pattern facilitates memory efficiency by pooling common data and
    isolating unique attributes for separate storage.


    Here, a ShipFactory spawns
    your fleet. The flyweight pattern conserves resources while maintaining a vast
    array of objects.'
  - "Use the <b>Memory Profiler (Window > Analysis > Memory Profiler)</b> to compare
    the memory usage before and after implementing the Flyweight pattern. \r\n\r\nWhile
    the savings per individual ship instance might seem minimal, the cumulative effect
    becomes substantial as the number of ships in your scene increases."
